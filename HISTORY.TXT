
      History of Changes for the Zeus for Windows Programmers Editor
      ==============================================================


Version 1.00
---------------

Initial release of the Zeus for Windows Version 1.00


Version 1.01
------------

1) Fixed:
Problem with electric keyboard expansion. The electric listbox is case 
insensitive but the search was done as case sensitive. This meant the 
following expansion did not work.
          
           "T"  1  "TRUE"

  Note: That the keyboard expansion is still coded to be case sensitive.

2) Fixed:
Tab characters where not being processed correctly in preprocessor
string. For example the following would paint incorrectly.
          
           #<tab char here>ifdef 

3) Fixed:
Tab characters where not being processed correctly when place within 
strings. For example the following would paint incorrectly.
          
           "<tab char here>this is a string with a tab in it"

4) Added:
Electric Expansion "\b" control character and changed search to limit
words with delimiters characters also (ie "(ifg<space>" would now
expand out).

6) Added:
Backup interval edit field to editor options dialog box.

7) Added:
If Zeus is minimised and a file is opened by double clicking or dropping
on the Zeus for windows icon (using the File Manager, Zeus file associations)
then Zeus will be restored to normal size.

8) Added:
The Open dialog now has persistence. It remembers the file extension filter 
last used (for the period of the edit session only).

Version 1.02
------------

9) Added:
New functions, Close, Close All and Save All added to the toolbar and 
Save All to the menu.

10) Added:
Standard CUA keyboard mappings for cut, copy, paste and marking have
been added to editor.

11) Added:
Better use of the hourglass for operations requiring CPU time.

12) Added:
Brief Ctrl-F5 toggle case sensitivity command.

13) Fixed:
Shift-Tab and Tab of marked moves the area with tabs or spaces
depending on the options editor "Replace tabs with space" option
(old version would always use spaces).


Version 1.03
------------

14) Fixed:
Major problem with non US keyboard drivers now fixed. For example Zeus would
cause crash if keyboard was set to German and an extended (Non ASCII) key 
was pressed. 

15) Fixed:
Problem with compiler not working over different disk drives. ie c:\zeus
could not compile file located in e:\project.

16) Added:
Error listbox font now matches the font selected for editing. This should
allow more of the error message to be seen (in the case of very long error
messages).

17) Fixed:
When the compiler is run in minimized mode, Zeus for Windows does not loose
active status any more (it use to switch to the program manager if it was
visible).

18) Added:
Brief Ctrl-K Kill to beginning of line command added.

19) Added:
Multiple file selection to the File Open dialog box added.

20) Added:
Extra messaging reporting added to the status line.

21) Added:
Ability to define two file open and file save as filters was added to the
editor setup dialog box.

21) Fixed:
Problem found when a stream marked area that contained tabs characters was
deleted or cut has been fixed.

NOTE: Version 1.03 Frozen
=========================

Sold first copy of Zeus for Windows V1.03 Editor. Zeus for Windows frozen 
at this version while work starts on the platform portable version of Zeus.


Version 1.04 (Start of portable version)
----------------------------------------

22) Fixed:
Any multi select file open on any root directory (ie a:\\filename.txt) cause
an error opening the selected files.

23) Fixed:
Double click on error list box would loose the status bar error when the
document was activated. Now the error is not lost on double click activation.

24) Fixed:
Added feature to editor setup that enables the size of the newly created MDI
window to be controled.

25) Fixed:
Smart indenting in overwrite mode would delete characters from the line below.
This has now been fixed.

26) Added:
Goto dialog and bookmark dialog now remember the last valid value entered.
This also gives better feedback via the status line.

27) Added:
The Error listbox now supports a horizontal scroll bar.

28) Added:
A Online Help QuickSearch feature was added to the Help menu popup.

29) Fixed:
The compiler error processing has been reworked in an effort to remove a few
strange bugs that would sometimes occur while compiler. Also a third 
parameter was added to the comand line passed to batch files while compiling
(see online help for details).

30) Added:
Added a new improved toolbar and status bar. It paints better, have less
flicker and removes some of the keyboard problems (ie alt key does not work
if the mouse pointer is on a toolbar button).

31) Added:
Added a the ability to show and hide the toolbar and status bar using the
menu options.

32) Fixed:
Hitting backspace at with the cursor at column position 0 does not delete
the character like it use to.

33) Fixed:
Searching for whole words was not working. This is now fixed.

34) Fixed:
The Replace dialog find and replace buttons where not working as would be
expected. This has now been fixed.

35) Fixed:
Reduced the amount of screen flicker when opening and closing the MDI windows.

36) Fixed:
Added error message if you try to compile a file that is changed and somehow
becomes write protected. Previously Zeus would just abort the compile without
an error.

37) Fixed:
Zeus would let you start mutiple compiles while the first compile was in 
progress. This eventually caused the system to GPF. Zeus has been fixed, so 
that it only allows one compile at a time.

38) Added:
The error window now supports the Control+Minus key (or file close menu)
option. If the error windows contains compiler output the control minus returns
you to the file that had been compiled and so it behaves like a revesrse to the
Control+P list errors keystroke.

39) Fixed:
The Open and Save As file dialog where modeless. The have now been made modal to
the main application.

40) Added:
The file restore at startup now restores the file and the line number on startup.

41) Added:
The insert/overwrite now have proper insert and overwrite carets (cursors) 
respecively, giving better visual feedback on the current insert mode.

42) Fixed:
The highlight code will highlight quoted strings differently to normal text. This
algorithm would work for the first quoted string but not for the second of two
quoted strings on the same line. For example:

         VALUE "CompanyName",      "Xidicone Pty Ltd",   "Zeus for Windows"

for the line above Atl-h would correctly highlight the first but not the second or
second strings. It now works correctly for all strings.

43) Added:
The compile process now reports if the compile was successful, has warnings or has
errors on the status line message field. Previously it only reported the compile 
was complete.

44) Fixed:
If the Enter key was hit while text was highlighted, the highlighted text was not
replaced by the enter key. This has now been fixed (NOTE: this ONLY applies when
the editor is in insert mode).


Version 1.05 (Start of Windows 3.x Windows 95 Combined Development)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

45) Fixed:
Fixed a few /****/ comment painting problems. I'm sure there are more to come!

Bug #1: Put the cursor on the middle of the first comment bar line and hit the
Alt-K key. Then hit undo and the painting does not return to the correct comment
state.

/*************************************************************/
This should return to none commented after the undo is done!
/*************************************************************/

Bug #2: Insert line number one into the the block comment then hit undo.

/* This is line number one (copy this line only)
*/

/*
 * This is the block comment
 * Insert the the one line above here!
*/

46) Added:
The search and replace dialog gives the user better feedback by using the status
line to display a message when things go wrong.

47) Added:
The editor setup option now allows you to toggle a left hand margin on or off.

48) Fixed:
Fixed 3 bugs with the comment colour highlighting /* comments */ processing. The
old code was getting out of synch after line insertions and deletions. The new
code has at least 3 less bugs to worry about.

48) Fixed:
Improved the background compile processing. For example by improving the message 
dispatch a typical background compile time has been reduced by 50% and loads
from floppy disk are much faster.

49) Added:
Added limited keyboard macro support to allow the recording and playback of simple
key strokes macros. Now supports F7, F8 and Ctrl-R commands.

50) Added:
Configurable colorize support based on file extension. This also allows things like
the keywords, comment character, preprocessor character, string character and 
delimiters characters to de defined for each file type.

51) Added:
The editor now supports a basic line wrap feature. This allows you to define a 
column at which the editor will automaticly line wrap, breaking the line on a 
word boundry.

52) Fixed:
Fixed a bug in the options editor dialog where the backup interval entry field 
was getting disabled incorrectly.

53) Added:
The file open can now be configuired to allow/not allow single or multiple loads of
files. This means that if the file is already loaded Zeus can be made to restore
the original rather than loading a second copy, or a second copy can be opened if
required.

54) Fixed:
Fixed a problem wil Zeus trying to open a file that was already opened by another
application. After the sharing violation message Zeus would protection violate. This
has now been fixed.

54) Added:
Added the ability to read and write unix text file in addition to the default standard
MS-DOS text file formats.

55) Added:
I have added as restore size feature. Zeus now remembers the size and position of the
main frame window between editing sessions.

56) Added:
If the error handler finds the error in and external file and that error is selected
from the error output window, the error handling will no try to open up the external
file and goto the line at fault.

57) Added:
Support for setting up and running external tools has been added to the main menu. Piping
of the results to an output window has also been added. Files can be loaded from the 
output window by just double clicking on any line in the output window, provided the 
line selected contains a valid file name.

58) Fixed:
The print support in Zeus has been totally re-worked. This has improved the printing
and hopefully fix the numerous problems with the old printing code.

59) Fixed:
The CUA marking has been fixed to also allow CUA marking while using the 
word left or word right keys. Also the ghost mark sometimes seen when CUA 
marking has been fixed.

60) Added:
The command line processing has been improved to allow the '?' and '*' wild card 
characters. This enabled multiple files to be loaded via the command line, for 
example when Zeus is run from File Manager or Program Manager men run commands.
