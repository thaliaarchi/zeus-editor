  CC.BAT: Example of an External Compile Batch File
  -------------------------------------------------
  Zeus will run most compilers, linkers and makers without problems, but in 
  some cases you may need to use an external batch file. The CC.BAT file is 
  an example of how to configure Zeus to run the compile using an external 
  batch file. To use the CC.BAT file just enter CC.BAT into the Run File 
  field of the Options Compiler dialog, making sure you have checked the 
  'Use other file' checkbox option first. Then just compile any file using 
  the Compiler Compile menu option to see the results.

  
  CTAGS: C/C++ Tag Example Tool
  -----------------------------
  The CTAGS.EXE is a simple tool designed to find all C/C++ functions,
  variables and definitions. For more information refer to the CTAGS.C
  file located in the zExample directory.
  
  To run this tool use and DOS command line, use the Zeus Tools
  Command Line menu option and run the command from the Zeus command
  line, or select the tool from the installed tool list of the Zeus
  Tools menu.
  
  To make this application you will need MSVC Version 1.5 or
  better or BC++ Version 4.5 or better. Just load the appropriate
  make or project file and build the application.
  
  The CTAGS example is made up of the following files:
  
     CTAGS.MAK   -  MSVC V1.5 project make file
     CTAGS.IDE   -  BCC 4.5 project make file
     CTAGS.EXE   -  CTAGS executable
     CTAGS.C     -  Main source file
     WILDCARD.C  -  Wildcard processing source file
     CTYPE.C     -  C types source file
     CTYPE.H     -  C types header file
     CONFIG.H    -  Configuration header file
  
  The CTAGS.EXE takes the following command line arguments:
  
     Usage: CTAG [flags] filenames...
     	-s  include static functions
     	-t  include typedefs
     	-v  include variable declarations
     	-r  generate a "refs" file, too
     	-a  append to "tags", instead of overwriting
        
  Examples: CTAGS.EXE -s ctag.c
            CTAGS.EXE -s -t -v *.c
  

  CINC: C/C++ Include Example Tool
  --------------------------------
  The CINC.EXE is a tool designed to scan the given C/C++
  for include files. The results of the scan can be displayed
  as a formatted tree output or as just a simple line output. 
  The utility will also scan system include files if asked to
  do so.
  
  The CINC example consists of the following file:
  
     CINC.MAK  -  MSVC V1.5 project make file
     CINC.IDE  -  BCC 4.5 project make file  
     CINC.EXE  -  CINC executable
     CINC.CPP  -  Main source file
  
  To run this tool use and DOS command line, use the Zeus Tools
  Command Line menu option and run the command from the Zeus command
  line, or select the tool from the installed tool list of the Zeus
  Tools menu.
  
  To make the application you will need MSVC Version 1.5 or
  better or BC++ Version 4.5 or better. Just load the appropriate
  make or project file and build the application.
  
  The CINC.EXE takes the following command line arguments:
  
     Usage: CINC [flags] filename
     	-s  search system include files also
     	-f  format the display output
     
  Example: CINC.EXE -f cinc.c

  
  FGREP: File GREP  Example Tool
  ------------------------------
  The FGREP.EXE is a simple GREP utility that can be used for 
  scanning files for text strings.
  
  The FGREP example consists of the following file:
  
     FGREP.IDE  -  BCC 4.5 project make file  
     FGREP.EXE  -  FGREP executable
     FGREP.C    -  Main source file
  
  To run this tool use and DOS command line, use the Zeus Tools
  Command Line menu option and run the command from the Zeus command
  line.
  
  To make the application you will need MSVC Version 1.5 or
  better or BC++ Version 4.5 or better. Just load the appropriate
  make or project file and build the application.
  
  For more information on using FGREP run FGREP.EXE -?  
   
  Example: FGREP.EXE -n Example *.txt
